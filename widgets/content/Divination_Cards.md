[Divination Cards](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Divination_card>) are cards that drop from monsters or chests.
These cards can be collected and turned in at certain NPCS (Tasuni in Act 4/9 and Navali) for rewards (of which are stated on the card, alongside how many needed to create a set).
For example, a complete set of 4 [Jack in the Box](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Jack_in_the_Box>) cards can be traded for 1 random unique item.
This website will soon show which map gives what cards, which can be seen when clicking on the maps on the atlas itself, as well as some advice and information as to what cards you should aim for and why.
