As you progress through the Atlas and explore the outer regions for the first time, you will encounter the [Conquerors][wiki:conquerors] of the Atlas.
In total there are 5 conquerors, with one, [Sirus][wiki:sirus], being a final boss that will be able to fight after defeating the 4 others. These 4 conquerors are:

 - [Al-Hezmin][wiki:al-hezmin], the Hunter: A chaos damage based conqueror that causes poisonous snakes and enemies to spawn when his presence is influencing a map.
 - [Baran][wiki:baran], the Crusader: A lightning damage based conqueror that spawns lightning monsters and mana-draining squares when his presence is influencing a map.
 - [Drox][wiki:drox], the Warlord: A physical damage based conqueror that spawns physical monsters and fortifying banners for enemies when his presence is influencing a map.
 - [Veritania][wiki:veritania], the Redeemer: A cold damage based conqueror that spawns cold monsters and cold monster spawning totems when her presence is influencing a map.

Finally, there is [Sirus][wiki:sirus], Awakener of Worlds.
He is the last conqueror, and can only be fought at [awakening level][wiki:awakening-level] 5, after the other 4 conquerors have each been defeated 5 times.
Sirus uses a mix of physical and chaos damage.

Atlas conquerors and map monsters affected by atlas conqueror influence can drop [influenced items][wiki:influenced-items].
Influenced items can roll mods from a special mod pool in addition to the regular one.

Conqueror exalted orbs, which add a conqueror influence to a piece of rare equipment, along with some specific unique items can also drop from the conquerors.
