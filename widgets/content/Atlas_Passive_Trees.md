As you progress through the fights with the Maven you will gain passive points for the Atlas Passive Tree, 2 per every encounter per region.

You can collect & spend a maximum of 10 points per region.
These points can be spent on the region's Atlas Passive Tree, allowing you to customize the types of endgame content you are likely to encounter in maps within that region.
All skill tree benefits apply only to their own region and do not interact with others.

These bonuses mainly focus on the additional side content that occasionally appears in maps, which is primarily content from previous leagues. (Blight, Metamorph, Abyss, Breach etc.)

You can respec these points using a new currency, the Orb of Unmaking.
