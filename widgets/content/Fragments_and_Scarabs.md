Using the map device, you can socket in [fragments](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Map_fragment>) and [scarabs](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Scarab>) that will modify 
the maps that you put in alongside it. 

Fragments are ones such as the fragments needed to fight Queen [Atziri](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Atziri,_Queen_of_the_Vaal>) (Which can mainly be dropped by vaal side areas, 
Queen Atziri herself or divination cards) or [The Pale Court](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Pale_Court>) (Which can be mainly dropped from completing one of the 4 
corresponding prophecy chains). <br>

Depending on the fragment, you will gain extra item quantity for maps. <br>
There are a total of 14 types of [scarab](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Scarab>) in the game with 4 tiers; Rusted, Polished, Gilded and Winged; 
with Winged being the highest tier. 
The differing tiers of the scarabs will grant different levels of power for the specific scarab. <br>
For example, a rusted breach scarab will add 1 breach to your map while a polished will add 2 and so-on. 
Scarabs are mainly found in Intervention safehouses from the Immortal syndicate but there are some other methods of getting them; 
most of which are linked to the current league mechanic.
