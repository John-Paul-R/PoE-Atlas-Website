As you complete maps, you get a chance to get a stored [master](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Master>) mission that you can use to add that master mission to your next map whenever you activate one, depending on the tier. The master missions you can currently get are:

  - [Alva](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Alva,_Master_Explorer>) (Incursion)
  - [Einhar](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Einhar,_Beastmaster>) (Bestiary)
  - [Jun](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Jun,_Veiled_Master>) (Betrayal)
  - [Niko](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Niko,_Master_of_the_Depths>) (Delve)
  - [Zana](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Zana,_Master_Cartographer>) (Extra Maps)

When viewing the atlas or map device you will be able to see the number of missions you have for each master and at what tiers(White, Yellow and Red) to the right or middle respectively. Note that the master missions you get are dependant on the tiers of maps you run, so running and completing T11+ maps will get you more red tier master missions.

Daily Master Missions:

Additionally, at 00:00 GMT, you will automatically gain one of every master mission of whatever tier map you last played. For example; if you played a T8 map last before the reset you will get 1 of each master mission in the yellow (middle) tier to run (5 missions in total). You must be online to get the missions for that day.
