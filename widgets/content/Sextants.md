While not used on the maps directly, you use [sextant](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Sextant>) on the watchstones that are gained from defeating conquerors and socketed
into region citadels.

Sextants will modify maps run in the region it is socketed into and can do things such as add extra packs of monsters, make monsters drop items identified
and even add master missions.

Sextants have 3 uses, opening a map from the region the sextanted watchstone is socketed in will take up a sextant use.

A comprehensive list of the sextant mods and what ones are the best to aim for, alongside some helpful sextant tips can be found [here](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Sextant#List_of_Modifiers>)
