As you progress through the fights with the Maven you will gain Atlas Passive Tree skill points, 2 per every encounter per region. <br> 
These points max out at 10 per region and allow you to customize how you want to play your maps. 
All skill tree benefits are only limited to their region and do not interact with others so be weary as to what you wish to focus on per region. <br>
These bonuses mainly focus on all the additional side content that occasionally appears in maps, which is mainly past-league content (Blight, Metamorph, Abyss, Breach etc.) <br>
You can respec these points using a new currency as well. <br>
A link to all the region's skill trees can be found [here](<https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3008533>).
