When opening a map using using the map device, you have the option to also socket in [fragments][wiki:map_fragment] and [scarabs][wiki:scarab].
These items will modify the maps that you put in alongside it.

Fragments are ones such as the fragments needed to fight Queen [Atziri][wiki:atziri] (Which can mainly be dropped by vaal side areas,
Queen Atziri herself or divination cards) or [The Pale Court][wiki:the_pale_court] (Which can be mainly dropped from completing one of the 4
corresponding prophecy chains).

Depending on the fragment, you will gain extra item quantity for maps.

There are a total of 14 types of [scarab][wiki:scarab] in the game with 4 tiers; Rusted, Polished, Gilded and Winged;
with Winged being the highest tier.
The differing tiers of the scarabs will grant different levels of power for the specific scarab.

For example, a rusted breach scarab will add 1 breach to your map while a polished will add 2 and so-on.
Scarabs are mainly found in Intervention safehouses from the Immortal syndicate but there are some other methods of getting them;
most of which are linked to the current league mechanic.
