[Harbingers orbs](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Harbinger%27s_Orb>) will upgrade maps into a map that is 1 tier higher (e.g turning a T10 map into a T11 map). <br>
The same rules apply to the Harbinger orbs as the Horizon orbs, and you cannot upgrade T16 maps as no naturally occurring T17 maps exist in the game. <br>
Using Harbinger orbs on maps also has a chance to turn it into a unique map called [the Beachhead](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Beachhead>), 
with differing stats depending on what tier map you used the orb on (T1-T5, T6-T10, T11-T15).
