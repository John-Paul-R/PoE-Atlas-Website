As you complete maps in the [Atlas][wiki:atlas] for the first time, you will gain 1 [Atlas Completion Bonus][wiki:atlas-completion-bonus] per map, if you can complete it at a certain rarity.
Tier 1-5 maps require a completion on magic versions, tier 6-10 maps require a rare map completion and T11-T16 maps need a corrupted rare completion to get the bonus.

Each Bonus adds a 1% chance for a dropped map to be upgraded one tier higher. At a bonus of 100, All maps dropped are automatically upgraded a tier, with extra bonuses contributing to upgrading a map twice.
The maximum map tier, however, cannot bypass drop restrictions, even if it would have been upgraded to a higher tier map.

An example of how map drops are restricted are as follows:

You kill a rare monster in a tier 6 map with 133% Atlas completion bonus.
This monster can drop maps that are up to the current map tier +1, meaning this monster can only drop tier maps of tier 1-7.
Additionally, only maps that are adjacent or already unlocked (completed) on your Atlas are in the pool of maps that can be dropped.

- If a tier 5 map drops it would be upgraded to tier 6, and have a 33% chance to be upgraded to tier 7.
- If a tier 6 map drops would be upgraded to tier 7, and cannot be upgraded any further.
- If a tier 7 map drops it is already the highest possible tier for this area, so it will not be upgraded further.
