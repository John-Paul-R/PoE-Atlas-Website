Awakened Atlas Completion bonus works similarly to normal [Atlas Completion Bonus](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Atlas_of_Worlds#Atlas_Completion_Bonus>) in how you achieve it but has different effects on maps you run on the atlas. Earning [Awakened Atlas Completion Bonuses](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Atlas_of_Worlds#Awakening_Completion_Bonus>) requires the map be cleared at certain [awakener levels](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Atlas_of_Worlds#Awakening_Level>) and at a certain tier; with the awakener level and map tier being on the high end.

What these bonuses do is the following:
\- 1% increased effect of Modifiers on non-unique Maps (per 6 Awakening Bonus).

For example; at 60 Awakening bonus a map modifier that originally will add 30% monster life and 10% increased item quantity will now give 33% monster life and 11% item quantity.

\- 1% chance to gain an Atlas Mission upon map completion (per 15 Awakening Bonus). This ties into the master missions you can earn and store while completing maps. This will increase the chance of getting a random master mission added to your map device when you complete a map.
