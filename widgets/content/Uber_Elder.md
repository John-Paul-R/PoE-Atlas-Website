which is one of the hardest boss encounters of the game. <br>
 
The Shaper will drop 1 of 2 fragments when you defeat him with the Elder doing the same. <br> 
The Shaper, Elder and UElder all drop shaper and elder influenced items and unique items that can only be found by defeating these bosses. <br>
