This mini-guide is mainly aimed towards players that have little to no experience with the [Atlas of Worlds](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Atlas_of_Worlds>) and will cover
the very basics of the system.

Other areas of this website will explain the more complex and deeper mechanics of this system and how to minmax them in order to progress as fast as possible or make as much profit
as you can with what you have.

The Atlas of Worlds is the end-game system for Path of Exile, and consists of 163 maps on an Atlas, all of which you can enter and traverse through.

To access maps you need to progress through the system through running and completing the maps (Usually by defeating the boss in the map).

You start getting map drops in the last couple of acts of the main storyline and currently the best way to sustain maps is through using currency to make the maps magic or rare,
making them harder but increasing the amount of map and currency drops in the process.

As you complete more and more maps you will gain access to newer, higher tiered maps and boss encounters, culmulating in a fight with the master of the Atlas.
