As you have reached maps you most likely know how [The Pantheon](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Pantheon>) works. Using Divine Vessels you can further enhance the benefits of the gods you have killed by placing them in the map device alongside the specific map that has a boss whose soul is able to be channelled into the vessel once you kill it. After defeating the map boss after having placed the vessel in your map device when activating the map. you can then take the now filled vessel to Sin in any town where he is available and he will empower your pantheon with the soul of the boss you just killed. The souls of these bosses provide all kinds of benefits such as a chance to avoid projectiles to things such as extra chaos resistance over chaos damage over time. Clicking here will take you to our Pantheon helper page, which lists all the god powers and what maps / bosses you need to run to be able to upgrade your pantheon.
