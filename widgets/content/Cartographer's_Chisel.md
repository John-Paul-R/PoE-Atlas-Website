One of the most basic Atlas currencies is the [Cartographers Chisel](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Cartographer%27s_Chisel>).
The chisel will increase the quality of a map by either *5%*, *2%* or *1%* if the map is *normal*, *magic*, or *rare/unique* respecitvely.

Map quality has a standard maximum quality of 20 and will increase the quantity of items that will be dropped in the map,
so if you want to get the most out of a good high tier map it is best to use chisels, preferably before you roll it.

There are other methods of getting map quality over 20 but they are usually rare and hard to grind so using chisels on
white maps and then rolling them for good mods is the most suggested.
