The Maven's Orb:
The Maven's orb is a new end-game currency that can only be dropped by deafeating the Maven herself. <br>
Much like the Awakener's orb, the Maven's orb allows for powerful crafting of influenced equipment.
How the Maven's orb works is by removing one influence mod and upgrading another. <br> 
This means that it must be used on an influenced item that has at least two influenced modifiers. Also note that the Maven's Orb only works with influenced body armour, helmet, gloves or boots. <br>
An example given is a vaal regalia with the crusader's influence and two influenced mods: 11% increased intelligence and 12% of physical damage from hits taken as lightning damage. <br>
Once the Maven's orb is used on it, the 12% of physical damage from hits taken as lightning damage mod dissapears and the 11% increased intelligence is upgraded, now additionally giving +1 to the level of socketed intelligence gems. <br>
