Some item bases can only drop from map monsters in the atlas. These bases are stronger than your typical item as they usually have implicits that provide hella sweet stats for free. An example would be two-toned boots, which give free extra resistance depending on the type you use. Normally boots do not have any implicits so using two-toned boots can give you up to 24% extra resistances than if you were to use normal boots. Clicking maps on the atlas will show you what atlas bases they drop and at what tier/awakening level. Usually higher tier versions of maps have a higher chance of dropping the bases alongside having a higher pool of atlas bases that can drop <br>
