Using [Orbs of Horizons](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Orb_of_Horizons>) on maps will change them into a different map of the same tier.
For example Tier 1 maps are Beach, Factory and Shore; using a Horizon orb on a beach map gives it a chance to either become a Factory or Shore map.

Be aware that not all maps can be obtained through just using Horizon orbs as Horizon orbs can only change maps to maps that naturally occur at that tier
(i.e have not been upgraded through socketing watchstones but instead are only found at that tier and up.).

An example of a high tier map would be a Summit map, which only appears as a T16 map (Has no lower tiers) and thus can be found by using a Horizon orb on a T16 map.
