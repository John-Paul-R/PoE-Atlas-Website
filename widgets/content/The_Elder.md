Similar to the Shaper, the [Elder](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Elder>) requires you putting the corresponding elder fragments in the map device, creating a set of portals to the Elder. Much like the Shaper, the elder also has 4 guardians that you must defeat in order to get their fragments to fight the Elder.

The 4 guardians are:

  - [The Enslaver](<https://www.poelab.com/the-Enslaver/>)
  - [The Constrictor](<https://www.poelab.com/the-constrictor/>)
  - [The Purifier](<https://www.poelab.com/the-Purifier/>)
  - [The Eradicator](<https://www.poelab.com/the-Eradicator/>)

Similarly to Shaper guardians, the Elder guardians occupy normal maps and have you face the guardians instead of the normal map boss. These guardian occupied maps can also only drop from high level map bosses, with higher awakener levels contributing to a higher percentage for the maps to drop.
