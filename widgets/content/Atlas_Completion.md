As you complete maps on the [atlas](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Atlas_of_Worlds>) for the first time you will gain 1 [Atlas Completion Bonus](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Atlas_of_Worlds#Atlas_Completion_Bonus>) per map, if you can complete it at a certain rarity. Tier 1-5 maps require a completion on magic versions, tier 6-10 maps require a rare map completion and T11-T16 maps need a corrupted rare completion to get the bonus. Each Bonus adds a 1% chance for a dropped map to be upgraded one tier higher. At a bonus of 100, All maps dropped are automatically upgraded a tier, with extra bonuses contributing to upgrading a map twice. The maximum map tier, however, cannot bypass drop restrictions, even if it would have been upgraded to a higher tier map. <br>

An example of how map drops are restricted are as follows: <br>

You kill a rare monster in a tier 6 map with 133% Atlas completion bonus: <br>

This monster can drop maps that are up to the current map tier +1, meaning this monster only can drop tier 1 to 7 maps. <br>

it will only drop maps that are adjacent or already unlocked (completed) on the atlas. <br>

\- If a tier 5 map drops it would be upgraded to tier 6, and have a 33% chance to be upgraded to tier 7. <br>

\- If a tier 6 map drops would be upgraded to tier 7, and cannot be upgraded any further. <br>

\- If a tier 7 map drops it is already the highest possible tier, and so will not be upgraded any further.
