The Maven is an eldritch entity that will appear during your progression through the atlas.

She will watch you fight map bosses while empowering them and making them more challenging.

The Maven will then remember the bosses that you faced per region and when you have progressed enough will give you an item that takes you you to an area where
you can fight multiple bosses simultaneously for rewards.

Clicking the Maven's beacon when creating a map will invite the Maven to come and witness your boss battle;
complete the encounter and she will remember the boss you just faced for later on.

One of the main rewards will be the Atlas Passive Tree skill points.

You will fight 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 bosses simultaneously in that respective order and be rewarded with 2 Atlas Passive Tree skill points per encounter per region,
with difficulty scaling upwards for every fight.

The final fight against 10 bosses is farmable for other rewards and you will occasionally be invited to fight the Maven herself with the posibility of getting new unique items
or the new Maven's Orb.
