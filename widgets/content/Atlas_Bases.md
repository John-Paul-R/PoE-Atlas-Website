Some item bases can only drop from map monsters in the Atlas.
These bases are stronger than your typical item as they usually have implicits that provide hella sweet stats for free.

An example would be [two-toned boots][wiki:two-toned-boots], which give free extra resistance depending on the type you use.
Normally, boots do not have any implicits, so using two-toned boots instead of another boot base can give a free boost of up to +24% to your resistances.

Usually, maps of higher tiers have a higher chance of dropping Atlas Bases and have a larger pool of Atlas Bases that can drop.

The PoE wiki has a useful [list of all Atlas Bases and where to find them][wiki:atlas-bases].
