Upon reaching maps you will have most likely already gone through [The Lords Labyrinth](<https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Lord%27s_Labyrinth>) 
three times and gained your ascendancy. <br>

There is a final tier of labyrinth, which can only be accessed through the completion of 6 trials that can only be found randomly in maps. <br>
The 6 trials correspond to the new threats you will face in the final lab and grant you an Offering to the Goddess upon completion, an item that you must have in your inventory 
if you wish to attempt the final lab. <br>
If you are having trouble finding your desired lab trials, look in global chat 820 (/global 820) for people offering theirs. For more information about the labyrinth, click [here](<https://www.poelab.com/labyrinth-guides/>).
